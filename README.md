# NMWB

[Roadmap](https://github.com/joelmandell/nmwb/projects/1)

You have to create a config.js on your own.
---
For example (all properties are mandatory):
```
***REMOVED***
	host:"localhost",
***REMOVED***
	db:"mwb",
	dbUser:"mydbuser",
	dbPass:"mypass",
	secret:"mysupersecret$@Â£$" //Secrey key for JWT.
***REMOVED***
```
Start it up:
---
npm run start
